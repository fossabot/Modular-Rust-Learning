This Rust program implements a simple password-protected vault that can save and load key-value pairs to and from a file. It uses the Argon2 hashing algorithm for password hashing and verification, and the serde library for serialization and deserialization of the vault data.


argon2: Provides the Argon2 password hashing algorithm.
serde: Provides serialization and deserialization capabilities.
std::collections::HashMap: A hash map for storing key-value pairs.
std::fs::File: For file operations.
std::io: For input/output operations.
thiserror::Error: For defining custom error types.
std::fmt: For formatting traits.
std::env: For accessing environment variables and command-line arguments.
indicatif: For creating progress bars.
std::thread and std::time::Duration: For simulating delays.


PasswordHashError wraps errors from the Argon2 password hashing library.
Implements fmt::Display for user-friendly error messages.
Implements std::error::Error to integrate with Rust's error handling.


VaultError is an enumeration of possible errors that can occur in the vault operations.
Uses thiserror::Error to derive error handling traits.
Each variant represents a different type of error, with appropriate error messages.


new: Creates a new, empty vault.
add_entry: Adds a key-value pair to the vault.
get_entry: Retrieves a value by key.
save_to_file: Serializes the vault, hashes the password, and writes both to a file.
load_from_file: Reads the file, verifies the password, and deserializes the vault.
